"""Pure, Textual-free git-worktree helpers.

This module imports no UI framework and no ``subprocess`` machinery — it
holds the deterministic computations (path layout, slug, porcelain
parsing) so they are unit-testable without spinning up a git repo or the
TUI. The side-effecting git calls live in ``uxon.cli`` and pass their
captured stdout into :func:`parse_worktree_porcelain`.
